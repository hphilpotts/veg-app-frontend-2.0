## learns for next time     
- proxy config is different with **Vite** when compared to using **Create React App**: see `vite.config.js` changes (rather than `package.json`).       
- React.Strict mode renders components twice - _so don't stress trying to work out why (for example) `useEffect` seems to be firing twice_...   

## bugs list
- originalDayData updated with just-added Food Items in LogFood when switching between input modes - work out how to prevent this
